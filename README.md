# 🌐 AnioResources: Open & Shareable Data Archive

**AnioResources** is an open data archive created and maintained by **AnioDevs**.  
Our goal is to collect useful, structured, and public-interest datasets — either produced by us or derived from reputable platforms like Wikipedia — and make them available in both raw formats (`.csv`, `.json`) and blog-style documentation (Markdown).

## 📁 Repository Structure

We organize our datasets into separate Git branches for clarity and license safety:

| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main` | Contains only documentation files such as `README.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, and contribution guides. |
| `open-data` | Datasets fully created or processed by AnioDevs and released into the public domain (no attribution required). |
| `licensed-data` | Datasets under licenses that **require attribution** or **enforce ShareAlike clauses**, such as Wikipedia or government open data. |
